**How exactly does wifi work on your airplane 35,000+ feet in the air? Here's a look at exactly how in-flight wifi keeps you connected to the world below.**

We'll discuss the basics of in-flight wifi, ground-based and satellite operating systems, and how moving from one atmosphere to another can affect the network performance.

BLOG OVERVIEW

In-Flight Wifi Basics
1. What is In-Flight Wifi?
    - Two operating system involved
        - ground-based 
        - satellite-based
    - how easy is it to access each of these "types" of in-flight wifi
        - comparing performance of each type
        - latency and throughput
2. What are performance metrics? 
    - latency (include graphs??)
    - throughput
    - bandwidth
    - how do we calculate these things
        - ways to test bandwidth on planes?
        - how can we analyze this information and use it to our benefit?
    - why are they important in terms of in-flight wifi
        - does this explain why wifi is generally slow on planes?
        - does it affect speed?
        - how does bandwidth affect type of information transmitted and vice versa?
3. Are there ways to improve performance?
    - what is currently available
    - what research is being done
    - what steps can we take to assist?
    - what companies are at the forefront?
