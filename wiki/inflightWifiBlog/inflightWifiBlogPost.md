**How exactly does wifi work on your airplane 35,000+ feet in the air? Here's a look at exactly how in-flight wifi keeps you connected to the world below.**

We'll discuss the basics of in-flight wifi, ground-based and satellite operating systems, and how moving from one atmosphere to another can affect the network performance.

Have you ever stopped to consider exactly how an e-mail or streaming video gets into your smartphone or tablet when you're cruising thousands of feet in the air? That's WiFi in action. When any two devices or machines need to communicate with each other, they need certain standards and protocols to be defined such that they are now able able to communicate. WiFi is that set of standards that defines communication for wireless computer networks. WiFi functions by using radio frequencies to send signals between devices. This radio frequency is different from that of your average walky talkie, car radio or weather radio, as WiFi transmits and receives data in the Gigahertz range. 

#So, what do this mean?
To break it down a little further, Hertz is only a measure of frequency. Let's say you were sititng by the ocean watching the wave roll in. If you were to count the number of seconds that passes between each wave, you'd be measuring the frequency of each wave. So, if 1 second were to pass between two waves, the wave frequency would be 1 Hz, or one cycle per second. In order to receive any information that is being send between these waves, the receiver needs to be set on a frequency that can read this incoming information at the correct rate. 

For WiFi, this frequency happens to be 2.5 Ghz or 5 Ghz (similar to that of a microwave!). The primary difference between these two frequencies lies in the range and bandwidth, which is the captacity of speed the network can provide. The 2.4Ghz frequency provides coverage over a larger range, but is only able to transmit data at lower speeds (smaller bandwidth), while the 5Ghz frequency provides coverage over a smaller range, but is able to transmit data at much faster speeds due to a larger bandwidth. 

#Is In-Flight WiFi the same?
*Is it the same case with in-flight wifi?*

Most of the technology behind the miracle of airplane wifi largely resembles that of wireless internet on the ground. Airplanes use many of the same towers and satellites that deliver data to our smartphones, connecting to towers on the ground, or to satellites, or to both.

In-Flight Wifi Basics
0. What even is WiFi?
    - we all talk about it, but how exactly does it work?
    - how are we able todo what what we do?

1. What is In-Flight Wifi?
    - Two operating system involved
        - ground-based 
        - satellite-based
    - how easy is it to access each of these "types" of in-flight wifi
        - comparing performance of each type
        - latency and throughput
2. What are performance metrics? 
    - latency (include graphs??)
    - throughput
    - bandwidth
    - how do we calculate these things
        - ways to test bandwidth on planes?
        - how can we analyze this information and use it to our benefit?
    - why are they important in terms of in-flight wifi
        - does this explain why wifi is generally slow on planes?
        - does it affect speed?
        - how does bandwidth affect type of information transmitted and vice versa?
