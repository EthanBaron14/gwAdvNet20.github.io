In this assignment, you will write a blog post on a networking topic that interests you. You should choose a topic that you feel you can cover in enough depth for a 10 minute presentation. While you will **not** be presenting it is a good gauge for how much detail to cover. The presentation of go routines given in class is a good example.

[Fork the class website repository here](https://github.com/gwAdvNet20/gwAdvNet20.github.io). You will create a fork of this repository and make a new file named `.md` in `/wiki/`. You will then submit by making a pull request to pull your blog post back into the class website.

[Create a code repo here](https://classroom.github.com/g/Aw_UzF1a). You will also need to create a repo that contains the code that you write for your blog post. In your blog post you should link to this repo.
